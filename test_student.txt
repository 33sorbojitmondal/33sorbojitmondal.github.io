Question: What is the difference between a recurrent neural network (RNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN)?
Answer: RNNs and CNNs are both networks, but RNNs are used for numbers and sequences, while CNNs are used for pictures.

Question: What is the role of heuristics in AI?
Answer: Heuristics in AI are things that help with problems.

Question: Describe the concept of reinforcement learning in AI.
Answer: Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions, aiming to maximize cumulative reward over time through trial and error.

Question: What is the Moravec's paradox?
Answer: Moravec's paradox is when AI is good at hard thinking but bad at easy thinking.

Question: What is the concept of attention in deep learning?
Answer: Attention mechanisms in deep learning allow models to focus selectively on relevant parts of input data while suppressing irrelevant information. This selective processing mimics human cognitive processes and enhances the performance of tasks like natural language processing and image understanding.
